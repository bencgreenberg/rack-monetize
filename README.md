The Rack Web Monetization Middleware offers support for handling status updates from the [Web Monetization API](https://webmonetization.org/docs/getting-started).

The middleware will process the status updates sent from a client, and if it is a valid status update it will pass it through the rest of the stack. If it is not a valid status then it will return a `403` HTTP status code to the application.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rack-monetize'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rack-monetize

## Usage

You can use `rack-monetize` either in a standalone application or mounted into a Rails application.

### As a standalone application

Install the gem on your system:

``` shell
$ gem install rack-monetize
```

Then require it from within your `config.ru` Rack configuration:

``` ruby
use Rack::Monetize::ProcessMonetizeState
```

An example [config.ru](examples/config.ru.example) can be found in the examples folder. More information on getting up and running with Rack can be found at the [Rack GitHub repository](https://github.com/rack/rack/wiki/(tutorial)-rackup-howto#with-a-ru-config-file).

### Mounted into a Rails Application

Require it in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem rack-monetize
```

And then add the middleware to your `config/application.rb` file to initialize it with your application:

```ruby
config.middleware.use Rack::Monetize::ProcessMonetizeState
```
